🌟 Java Hub

A structured collection of Core Java programs, Spring/Spring Boot examples, and Java project ideas for learners and developers.
This repository helps you understand concepts from fundamentals → backend development → real-world implementation.

🟩 Core Java (Fundamentals & Programming Essentials)

Core Java builds the base of Java development. It helps you learn logic building, memory flow, object handling, and writing clean, reusable code.

📌 Topics Covered

🔹 Variables, Data Types, Operators

🔹 Conditional Statements (if/else, switch)

🔹 Loops (for, while, do-while)

🔹 Methods, Functions & Recursion

🔹 Arrays & String Handling

🔹 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Inheritance

Polymorphism

Abstraction

Encapsulation

🔹 Exception Handling

🔹 Collections Framework (List, Set, Map)

🔹 File I/O & Multithreading

🟥 Spring & Spring Boot (Backend Framework)

Spring is an enterprise-level framework used to build scalable Java applications.
Spring Boot enhances it with auto-configuration and rapid API development capabilities.

📌 Concepts Included
