Java Hub

This repository is a complete collection of Core Java concepts, Spring Framework fundamentals, and Java project ideas, aimed at helping learners grow from basics to application-level development. It acts as a mini-reference hub where you can explore syntax, logic building, backend development patterns, and real-time implementations in Java.

🔹 Core Java Overview

Core Java forms the foundation of the Java ecosystem. It covers programming essentials, logic development, and Object-Oriented concepts that prepare you for advanced frameworks like Spring and Hibernate. The programs in this repository focus on understanding how Java works internally and how to write structured and reusable code.

Key Areas Included

Variables, Data Types & Operators

Conditional Statements (if-else, switch)

Loops (for, while, do-while)

Methods, Functions & Recursion

Arrays, Strings & Pattern-based problems

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Exception Handling & File I/O

Collections (List, Set, Map)

Multithreading & Synchronization

🔹 Spring & Spring Boot Overview

Spring is one of the most popular Java frameworks for building scalable and maintainable applications. It follows Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection (DI), making application development modular and flexible. Spring Boot further simplifies the setup by providing auto-configuration, embedded servers, and production-ready features.

Concepts Covered

Spring Core, Beans & Application Context

Dependency Injection with XML & Annotation Config

Creating Spring Projects and Config Classes

Spring Boot REST APIs & HTTP Endpoints

Controller → Service → Repository Architecture

CRUD Operations with JPA / JDBC

Database Connectivity & Table Operations

🔹 Java Project Ideas

To build practical understanding, the repository includes sample projects and ideas that reflect real-world requirements. These help apply theoretical knowledge into working solutions and strengthen backend development skills.
